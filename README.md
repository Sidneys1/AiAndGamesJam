# ANTS

Today, you make the decisions!

## Gameplay

Each level contains a randomly generated playing field, goal and, potentially, adversaries, and is generally more
difficult than the last.

You as the player coordinate Ant's queue of Jobs. Each Job has a priority (e.g., "x2") and idling Ants will randomly
select a Job from the list. Higher priority Jobs have a higher chance of being selected. To create Jobs, see the
Controls section below.

Anthills can be given tasks such as creating more Ants, or stockpiling Food.
To change an Anthill's task, select it and see the (C)reate and (S)tockpile controls below.
Creating more Ants consumes 20 food every 3 seconds as long as the Anthill has at least 25 Food stored.
